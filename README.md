This code uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and calculates the sum of cubes and sum of squares of these numbers in each iteration. It declares two variables, sum_of_cubes and sum_of_squares, and initializes them to 0. In each iteration, the current value of i is cubed and added to sum_of_cubes, and i squared and added to sum_of_squares. The for loop is initialized with i = 1, the loop will continue as long as i is less than or equal to 10 and i is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
After the loop finishes executing, the code prints the final value of sum_of_cubes and sum_of_squares using printf, which is the standard C library function for printing to the console.
The "return 0" statement at the end of the main function indicates that the program has run successfully.
